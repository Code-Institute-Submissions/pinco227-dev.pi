  Deployment steps
- ### Forking the GitHub Repository
  By forking the GitHub Repository we make a copy of the original repository on our GitHub account to view and/or make changes without affecting the original repository by using the following steps:
  1. Log in to GitHub and locate the [Dev.PI repository](https://github.com/pinco227/dev.pi).
  2. At the top right of the Repository just above the "Settings" Button on the menu, locate and click the "**Fork**" Button.
  3. You should now have a copy of the original repository in your GitHub account.
- ### Making a Local Clone
  1. Log in to GitHub and locate the [Dev.PI repository](https://github.com/pinco227/dev.pi).
  2. At the top of the Repository just above the list of files, locate and click the "**Code**" dropdown.
  3. To clone the repository using HTTPS, under "**Clone**", make sure "**HTTPS**" is selected and copy the link.
  4. Open Git Bash.
  5. Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory to be made.
  6. Type ```git clone```, and then paste the URL you copied in Step 3.
    ```
    $ git clone https://github.com/pinco227/dev.pi.git
