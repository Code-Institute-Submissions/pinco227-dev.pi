    - For consistency, the interface offers a subtle visual feedback to the user (on hover, focus and press of buttons and fields) which is similar throughout the application and helps the user to quickly learn the functionality.
  - Information architecture
    - The content is organised and prioritised by importance from top to bottom and left to right.
    - For consistency, the information is presented in the rule of 3 on large screens and individual on small screens.
    - The information is structured mostly in nested lists.

  - ### Improvements
    - #### **Client Side**:
      - #### All pages:
        - Breadcrumbs between header and content
      - #### Landing page
        - Icons for education and experience items but no icon for testimonials.
      - #### Blog Post page
        - The post cover photo is displayed on the left.
      - #### Contact page
        - Profile Picture is displayed instead of person icon and is not hidden on mobile.
    - #### **Admin Panel**:
      - #### All pages:
        - The layout is completely separate and different from the client side, different navbar which only includes **App** and **Logout** buttons and the menu panel is now a full height sidebar, no footer.
        - On mobile, menu is expandable from the navbar and it covers the whole page.
        - A svg image on top right of every page (centered on mobile), representing the page's subject.
      - #### Dashboard:
        - Notifications panel is displayed in yellow and only if there are notifications.
        - Extra panel with quick links.
      - #### Get Items (list) page
        - Preview button for blogs and projects and no edit button for testimonials, skills and links.
      - #### Update (item) page and Settings page
        - There is a new panel for drag&drop photo upload on blog and project and edit page and on settings page, displayed beside the initial form.
- ### Design Choices 
  - #### Colours
    - The colour palette consists of different shades of blue inspired by the "Colours of Santorini".  
    ![Colour Palette](https://github.com/pinco227/dev.pi/blob/main/docs/palette.png)
    - According to [The Psychology of Color](https://www.toptal.com/designers/ux/color-in-ux), the chosen colours represent optimism, loyalty and reliability.
    ![Colour Psychology Wheel](https://github.com/pinco227/dev.pi/blob/main/docs/colour-wheel.jpg)  
    - The 60-30-10 Rule was also taken into consideration when building the project. The light shades which are used mostly for background are considered neutral and makes up to 60% of the palette. The dark shades are complementary and makes up to 30% while the accent colours completes the remaining 10% of the design. The landing page is an exception from this rule as it is divided into multiple sections and uses all colours to create contrast between these.
  - #### Typography
    There are three fonts used throughout the project. Two main fonts used for content and headings, both having a ```sans-serif``` typeface and fallback . These font-faces inspire a clean and modern aspect. The third font is a ```monospace``` typeface used for brand text (logo) only to make it look like a piece of code:
    - [Lato](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lato?query=lato) is used as a general font.
    - [Alegreya Sans](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Alegreya+Sans?query=Alegreya+Sans) is used for h1, h2 and h3 headings.
    - [Source Code Pro](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Source+Code+Pro?query=Source+Code+Pro) is used for brand text and it has a ```monospace``` fallback.

## Deployment
- ### Forking the GitHub Repository
  By forking the GitHub Repository you make a copy of the original repository on your GitHub account to view and/or make changes without affecting the original repository by using the following steps:
  1. Log in to GitHub and locate the [Dev.PI repository](https://github.com/pinco227/dev.pi).
  2. At the top right of the Repository just above the "Settings" Button on the menu, locate and click the "**Fork**" Button.
  3. You should now have a copy of the original repository in your GitHub account.
- ### Local Machine
  1. Log in to GitHub and locate the [Dev.PI repository](https://github.com/pinco227/dev.pi) (or the forked repo into your profile).
  2. At the top of the Repository just above the list of files, locate and click the "**Code**" dropdown.
  3. To clone the repository using HTTPS, under "**Clone**", make sure "**HTTPS**" is selected and copy the link.
  4. Open Git Bash.
  5. Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory to be made.
  6. Type ```git clone```, and then paste the URL you copied in Step 3.
      ```bash
      git clone https://github.com/pinco227/dev.pi.git
      ```
  7. Press Enter. Your local clone will be created.
      ```bash

      os.environ.setdefault("MONGO_URI", "<mongo_uri>")
      os.environ.setdefault("MONGO_DBNAME", "<db_name>")
      ```
      > Make sure you add this file to **.gitignore** file so it will not be published.
  9. Install required `python` packages by running the following command into terminal:
      ```bash
      pip3 install -r requirements.txt
      ```
  10. Run app bu typing the following into terminal:
      ```bash
